# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game-
Project Title: Stone Paper Scissor – 1vComputer Game
<br><br>
Project Overview:<br>
"Stone Paper Scissor" is a simple yet engaging 1v1 game where users play against the computer in the classic game of rock-paper-scissors (stone-paper-scissor). Designed to be a quick and fun way to pass time, this game challenges the player to outsmart the computer by choosing the right move—stone, paper, or scissor—while the computer generates its own random choice.
<br><br>
Features:<br>
1. 1vComputer Gameplay: The user competes against a computer opponent, which randomly selects between stone, paper, and scissor.<br>
2. Randomized Computer Choice: The computer's move is generated using a randomization algorithm, ensuring unpredictable and fair gameplay.<br>
3. Result Display: After each round, the game displays whether the player won, lost, or if it was a tie.<br>
4. Boredom Buster: As a quick, easy-to-play game, it helps users take a break or unwind between tasks.<br>
5. User-Friendly Interface: A simple text-based interface in the C programming language allows the player to interact smoothly without distractions.<br>
<br><br>
Development Background:<br>
This project was created during the developer's first year of college as an introduction to programming with C. It helped the developer grasp basic concepts like conditionals, loops, and random number generation, while also applying logic and creativity to a fun game.
<br><br>
Technologies Used:<br>
-  Language: C<br>
-  Concepts: Random number generation, conditionals, loops
<br><br>
The "Stone Paper Scissor" project stands as a testament to the developer’s early programming skills, offering a practical, interactive way to practice C programming while creating a fun tool to beat boredom.
